# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
  > Timely project delivery is important in ensuring that the overall objective and scope of the development lifecycle of the project is maintained and achieved. Time is an important factor when it comes to the production process and ensuring that both costs and deliverables are within the stipulated timelines minimizes friction between collaboration.
> Project managers should ensure that effective communication is prioritized by incorporating management tools for example: Trello, Jira and Other Project Trackers that ensure that deliverables are tracked. This will foster a stronger sense of collaboration and accountability when it comes to roles and tasks.

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
  > Cost control is important in ensuring the microeconomics involved in a project are considered. Time & Money are the greatest factors that contribute to the success of a project not including the importance of Human Capital, however since costs can contribute to the quality and workload therein, a proper financial responsible outlook will ensure that unneccessary expenses are capped and a more financial literate approach is adopted in regard to the budget provided.
> Some strategies that can be used to prevent budget overruns would include:
1. Budget Estimation - This means creating a realistic budget outlook that acts a guide to the cost estimates to be incurred.
2. Elaborate Planning - Creating a comprehensive project plan highlighting the different stages, phases and milestones that minimizes overall changes to the project during development.
3. Cost Audting & Monitoring Control - Ensuring a real time and detailed audit of project cost should  be conducted frequently to ensure that budget estimates are managed.
4. Open Communication Policy - Institutionalize a culture of open communication is important in fostering a cohesive working environment that allows for transparency and accountability that is important in ensuring that issues that could affect the project are sorted out early.

   
## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
  > Agile Methodology in software development involves the incremental iteration of software development this means that the project is broken down into smaller units normally called sprints during which project features are build before the final iteration is integrated to the final project build improving on the project features.
  > Advantages:
     Adaptability: due to the number of iterations that can be made to the project agile development proves to be a very adaptable strategy to the changing consumer and market preferences.
    Collaboration: Working together with the users of the project ensures that the project aligns with the needs and expectations of the users and developers of the system.
     Quality Assurance: The quality of the project greatly improves due to the consistent review and iterations that the software goes through.
  > Disadvantages:
      Scope of the Project: Due to the continous iteration of the project this can easily overwhelm the scope of the project if not properly managed where an uneccessary amount of time is spend on feature development.


  > Waterfall Methodology in software development follows a chronological order of steps in the development of the project with a clear and comprehensive project plan with milestones and steps that are involved. You can only proceed to the next step once the previous step has been completed.
  > Advantages:
      Structure Oriented: Due to the sequential nature of this methodology understanding the expected deliverables and the scope of the project is simple and easier to manage.
      Well Documented: Since we cannot proceed with different phases until they have been completed and approved the documentation and logs of the project are easier to create with a high degree of accuracy.
  > Disadvantages:
     Time to Deliver: Using the waterfall method can take a considerable amount of time due to the linear nature of execution. If there's an issue that delays a particular phase of development, that issue(s) must be resolved before moving forward. Unlike agile development where other features could be concurrently developed as the issue is resolved, waterfall proves constraint.
    Testing: As testing falls as among the final phases of project development, critical issues may be dicovered at a later stage of the development creating bottlenecks and production issues that may interfere with the product delivery.
 

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
  > Agile is great for products whose market preferences and tastes are constantly evolving and require constant updates: Some industries would include E-Commerce, Betting & Social Media.
  > Waterfall is great for products that breakdown a process that is repeated over and over again meaning the changes involved will be small.Some industries would include: CRM Apps, Legacy & Logistics Systems.


## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
  > Requirement Analysis: Having a clear documentation of the scope, goals and objectives of the project are important in ensuring that both developer and stakeholder interests are represented and clearly communicated.
  > Peer Reviews: Ensuring that a collaborative and community approach is implemented in the development ethos of the engineers. By having others review changes that are made to the project during development ensures that code is secure and works.
 > Code Quality & Standards: Ensuring that the code gudelines for development are followed and that the code been written is not redunant and repetitve. Writing simple and elegant code will do.
  > Testing: Ensuring continous testing of units, features and systems will make sure that code errors, bugs and other issues such as performance & security are addressed
  > CI/CD: Building automated worflows and pipelines to manage code deployment, testing and building will greatly improve code output.


## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
  > The project scope is important in creating a guideline of the expected deliverables, goals and objectives of the project. With a well and detailed scope the project can be managed, delegated and improved through a comprehensive outline of the project phases.
  > A Work Breakdown Structure is outline diagram that elaborates the structured view of the deliverables & tasks that need to be accomplished. It helps organize and define the total scope of the project. This approach provides clarity, control & accountability of what the roles and tasks of team members are.

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
  > Time management: This ensures that the project is broken down into actionable chunks this ensures that project delivery is within the estimated time frame. This helps in ensuring that the project is delivered to the different stakeholders in a timely manner.
  > Business Needs: A project has the enterprise nature that supports it from a legal entity to the different compliant needs, a project schedule ensures that the project conforms to the compliance nature of different stakeholders while it is in the pipeline before release.
  > Gantt Charts are a project management tool that helps visually represents the project with start and end dates. This makes it easier to manage and track the progress of the software development lifecycle by coordinating & monitoring specific tasks and activites within a project.


## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
  > Stock Trading App: Software should aim to simplify the process of automating simple everyday trades of the user. Using the computational efficiency of computers and the mathematical accuracy of software, the program should provide real time data & insights into the stock buying process.
  > Financial markets are dynamic and constantly evolving, an accurate representation of the market at a given point in time is crucial in buiding automated financial assistants.

 
## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
  > Problem elaboration proves to be invaluable due to the context it provides and the approach it advocates when building solutions. A well defined problem is defined and validated by users whose pain point is clearly elaborated through extensive market research. This ensures that the market fit and user acceptance of the product are aligned.


## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
  > A Stock Trading App that takes the guesswork out of trading by providing real time financial insights that can be incorporated into your trading strategy without leaving the comfort of your palm.
